# What Pages I am going to need
	index page- 
	animal list page- view everything about those animals 
	use pipe to sort young and old animals by age
	Click the animal to be able to edit its name age or number of caretakers
	
# Style
	Going with the zoo theme I think I'll try to find something Zootopia theme for the banner to have for each page.
  I might try to get modals working
  I am probably going to use Angular CLI in order to get it all working and organize things better

# Future Things to Implement
	I would like to hide the form page or have it link to a different page in order to show the form.
  I would like to have the form show up in a modal that pops up on the page.
